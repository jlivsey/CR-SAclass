# CR-SAclass

Material for USCB Class on Seasonal Adjustment taught in Costa Rica 2019

This repo contains:

`\data` :  all the data files needed for the course exercises.

`\slides` : the course slides

`\software` : three of the subfolders are programs we'll use in class -- Win X-13, X-13-Graph, and Genhol. The subfolders R seasonal and X13 Documentation include the manuals for X-13 and the R seasonal program, and some other useful documents.

`\worksheets` : The exercises we'll complete in class. If you want to print them out, only the .doc/.docx files should be printed; the Excel exercise is a computer exercise and does not need to be printed.

Finally, the course syllabus is included in the folder. 

I recommend that everyone create a folder C:\X13 and save everything in the repository there.

People will be able to do all the exercises with Census software -- Win X-13, X-13-Graph, and Genhol. If they want, they can instead do most of them in R (one is not available in R). If they want to use R (and it isn't necessary, so people who are not familiar with it do not need to use it), then they should also have R installed on their computers and should run:

`install(seasonal)`

`install(shiny)`  

`install(seasonalview)`
